Social Network

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/3qshBpmEFbg

#### Description:

In this project my objective is to create a platform for user to comment and interact. I have my inspiration from twitter where user can post, comments and share their ideas via an online platform.
In this project there are 6 main files in which differences files may be use to support one another. For instance for my social and social networking files. The main purposes for this is to create and design the main forum for user to see the comment and post it themself. Whereas for the landing page it purposes is to create the design images in the forums etc. To be able to run the code I must also use django to create the website using pip3 install django-allauth django-crispy-forms
The purposes I create many file I think it is better to organise or the file into order and each one of them can support each other in a way.
I must admit that during my development of this project I had come to face with many obstacle but I did spend my time researching online for solutions, in which I can not thanks me alone but others who support and help me to solve the errors and from this project hopefully I can grow and become a great programmer one day.
